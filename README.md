# personalWebsite
In this project, I tried to create my own website which is like a CV. There is my current education status and some information about me. Also, there are my social media accounts. Moreover, there is a contact form. You can use it to send e-mail to me directly. You guys can change the informations according to yourself and create your own website. You should upload a your photo which you want to use in your website and you must refer to "pic". Its format must be jpeg. These are just front-end codes so there is not Javascript code that's why you can not use send e-mail option. I have just added two photos about website.

And here there is the example website:
